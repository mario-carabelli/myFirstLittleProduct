# myFirstLittleProduct
This will be a little project where I'll build something useful for me and for others. I will follow the phases of https://productschool.com/blog/product-management-2/career-path/7-phases-of-product-development/ to find and create a useful product. I switched them up a bit so that everything starts with a capital D and makes sense for my context (which is a limited Project

For each phase will note down my assumptions, experiments and results in regard to the the phase. The assumption I follow here is that writing my thinking down explicitely will help me to think things through and revisit my decisions later on to learn. Because this is a solo-side-project I will take shortcuts and easy way outs from time to time. Thats okay.

# First Phase Disovery and MVP
## Discover
The phase where you brainstorm a lot of ideas of problems which need a solution, and test them on viability (Criteria: Is this a problem customers would pay for a solution? Is this a problem where I am able to deliver a technical solution. Is this a problem which would be useful to me?=
## Define
I will list the things the MVP of a solution to this discovered problem needs to be able to do to be valuable. This should be the absolute minimal feature set, so that I can test my assumptions from the discover step
## Design
Design the MVP
## Do
Implement the MVP
## Differentiate
Create a Marketing Story for the MVP, and Sell it to an audience
## Document
Document the features for users and contributors.
## Deploy
Deploy the MVP to first customers and gather feedback and experiences.

# Next phases of MVP or pivot
If the MVP was doing good enough I will go through the phases again, to make my product better.
